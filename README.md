# Rock Paper Scissors 🪨📄✂️

A simple and fun Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects its move — the result is displayed instantly along with a running score!

This project was part of the [**Foundations Course** on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I practiced JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## 🔧 What I Learned

- Brushed up on **JavaScript basics** like:
  - Functions
  - Conditionals

- Implemented **basic DOM manipulation**:

  - Adding event listeners to buttons
  - Updating scores and results dynamically
- Practiced **clean structuring** of HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Hosted the project using **GitHub Pages**
